  value: "While it may be true that Paris as an entity is probably the single largest
    clich\xE9 that the\r European continent has to offer, that doesn't make it any
    less of a wonderful place to live and\r work in. I can't say that I for one would
    trade it for any other place. The buildings, the water,\r the trees... A sunset
    by the Seine is always a sight to behold."
